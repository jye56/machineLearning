# Machine learning project

* Thank you for evaluating my project on machine learning. This is an interesting project. It is the project that I've spend the most time on out of all the projects in the series so far. However, I tried to make the writeup shorter for the ease of evaluation. 

* The ".md" file knitted by R console has error message in the data tidying up portion, but the unwanted columns were deselected and knitting produced an adequate file. This is not observed when .Rmd file was knitted with R studio. The reason is unclear to me.
